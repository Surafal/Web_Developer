- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project
2. Install dependencies:

npm install
```

3. Install Playwright browsers:

```bash
npm run install-browsers
```

## Usage

1. Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

2. **Configure the target**:
   - Enter the URL of the web page with the upload form
   - Specify the CSS selector for the file input (default: `input[type='file']`)
   - Optionally add a submit button selector

3. **Add custom steps** (optional):

## Troubleshooting

### Browser doesn't launch
- Ensure Playwright browsers are installed: `npm run install-browsers`
- Try running without headless mode first

### Files not uploading
- Check that your file input selector is correct
- Use browser DevTools to inspect the actual selector
- Some sites use hidden file inputs - try selecting the parent element

### Custom steps not working
- Verify selectors are correct using browser DevTools
- Add wait steps between actions if the page loads slowly
- Check the logs for error messages
